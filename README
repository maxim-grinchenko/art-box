# SBT Company Wide Settings Example

Company wide settings, a.k.a. Bill Of Materials (BOM from now on), can be implemented in [SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org/) using [plugins](http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/docs/Getting-Started/Using-Plugins.html).

The example is split up in two separate SBT projects, each in its own directory:

* `bom`: the Bill Of Materials
* `model`: a dummy project depending on the BOM

Of course, in a real project, you would have one BOM and several projects depending on it. Changing a setting in the BOM would then propagate the modification to the dependent projects.
